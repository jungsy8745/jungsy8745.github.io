I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I study political psychology and biopolitics.

My research agenda centers on the formal and substantive aspect of citizenship. My dissertation project examines the influence of social context on political tolerance. I explain the level of political tolerance with sociotropic consideration, partisan conformity, and salience of positive consequences of political tolerance. In one of the papers, I test whether individuals are motivated to conform their attitudes to those of co-partisans regarding their willingness to act on political intolerance, and I address the biological underpinnings of this relationship by observing the moderating role of oxytocin hormone. 

Another stream of research interest is the role of dual citizenship on state attachment and political participation. For the measure of state attachment, I use both self-reported and implicit self-state associations.
