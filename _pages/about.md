I am a postdoctoral fellow at Consortium on Electoral Democracy (C-Dem). I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at the University of Illinois.

My research agenda centers on the formal and substantive aspect of citizenship. I have a research agenda examining political tolerance, defined as a willingness to permit civil liberties by members of disliked groups. The three working papers highlight the context-sensitive nature of political tolerance and zoom into citizensâ€™ decision-making processes.

Another stream of research interest is the role of dual citizenship on state attachment and political participation. For the measure of state attachment, I use both self-reported and implicit self-state associations.

Here is my [CV](http://seyoungjung.com/cv_seyoungjung.pdf)
